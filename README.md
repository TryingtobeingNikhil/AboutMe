# Hi, I'm Nikhil

Just a human training machines to understand humans.  
ML / DL / LLM guy who talks to GPUs more than people.

## What I Do (besides Googling errors)

- Build and break deep learning models  
- Deploy stuff on the cloud and hope it doesn't crash  
- Tame large language models with small patience

## Tech Arsenal

Python • TensorFlow • OpenCV • Scikit-Learn  
Flask • Google Cloud • Pandas • NumPy  
(+ occasional C++ when I miss the semicolons)

## Projects & Chaos

- Hospital ML System — Predictive analytics for hospitals, built during SIH  
- Scene-Aware Image Coloring — Teaching AI to paint grayscale worlds  
- Hackathons — IIIT Delhi & TriNit: ML experiments gone surprisingly well

Currently fine-tuning models... and my sleep schedule.
